# C323 Final Project

This is a delivery and food ordering app. It has 8+ locations with images and 5+ foods per location. Orders can be tracked and reordered along with a calender to show daily cost amounts and weekly costs.
NOTES: Bonus for calendar view was completed. If the user is on the same day of an order, an icon won't appear but previous days will have a dot to represent an order. Clicking a bar in the graph updates the info about the daily spending.
Map and Calendar fragments can be accessed without orders.
Recent orders screen gives the orders made on that day.
All orders screen gives the orders made for the entire user period.
In the Home screen, search lets the user search on names for a restaurant.
In the all orders screen, search lets the user search for old orders based on name.
